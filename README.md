# About
Here you can find my solutions for days 1-12 (day 12 part 2 unfinished) of the annual coding challenge "Advent of Code", written in Typescript.
You must have node.js installed on your system to be able to set up and test the project.

## Setup
- Enter your desired directory and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tadejrebernjak/advent-of-code-2023-typescript.git
```
- Move into the created directory:
```bash
cd advent-of-code-2023-typescript
```
- Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```
- Build javascript files (this will generate javascript scripts which are called from index.js)
```bash
npm run build
```

## Running the scripts
- Run all days in order
```bash
npm run all
```
OR
```bash
node index.js all
```
- Run a specific day
```bash
node index.js [1-12]
```
